##### 14:00
I'm feeling bored and I think I should work on something. Yesterday we discussed about implementing a feature so that people could post testimonials about the event that they attended. While the meeting is schedules to take place at night, I think I should get started with it.

**Hurdle 1 - ** The Admin Pages are broken. There is an error which is making the components which rely on the `<ProtectedRouteAdmin />` not being able to render properly.  
After banging my head on the wall for 30 minutes, I figured out the error, the props! The component was being passed as render prop and not as a component which complicated stuff for the route handler. 

**Hurdle 2 -** The `react-slick` is working in a very weird manner. There seems to be a property bug and since I didn't implement the feature, I'm not even able to figure out the code. But I guess that's the most important part of being a developer. *Understanding code written by other people, optimizing it, and making great stuff with it.* I have been in support of creating a documentation since day 1 and now I feel that it is strongly required.

I finally got to implementing the testimonials feature. Pretty straightforward if you ask me. Create a map, store the UID with their testimonial and we are done.

##### 17:00
Done with that. Wow, that was fast! 

Time for the [Leetcode challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/582/week-4-january-22nd-january-28th/3615/). I have never worked on a problem like this since I always thought that it requires a lot of knowledge but here I am, trying to figure out a way to solve this question.

The first approach I can think of is to combine two lists and then two, and so on.
Okay, that seems to simplify the problem a bit. Writing the code for merging two lists doesn't seem to be that big a problem.

Now what?  
Well, now I have to figure out a way to merge lists one by one. Let's say I have `n` lists.

|Merge|Nodes left|
|-|-|
|1 and n|1 to n-1|
|2 and n-1|1 to n-2|
|3 and n-2|1 to n-3|
|...|...|
|1 and n/2|1 to (n/2) - 1|
|...|...|

That looks great. So merge the lists one by one using 2 pointers, then when 2<sup>nd</sup> pointer gets lesser than 1<sup>st</sup>, change 1<sup>st</sup> to 0.

And that works! Nice! Woah!

```cpp:title=merge-k-sorted-lists.cpp
ListNode *mergeTwoLists(ListNode *l1, ListNode *l2) {
    if (!l1) return l2;
    if (!l2) return l1;

    ListNode *head = new ListNode();
    ListNode *ans = head;

    while (l1 != NULL && l2 != NULL) {
        if (l1->val < l2->val) {
            head->next = l1;
            l1 = l1->next;
            head = head->next;
        } else {
            head->next = l2;
            l2 = l2->next;
            head = head->next;
        }
    }

    if (l1 == NULL) {
        head->next = l2;
    } else {
        head->next = l1;
    }

    return ans->next;
}

ListNode *mergeKLists(vector<ListNode *> &lists)
{
    int i = 0, j = lists.size() - 1;

    if (lists.size() == 0) return NULL;

    while (i < j) {
        lists[i] = mergeTwoLists(lists[i], lists[j]);
        i++;
        j--;
        if (i >= j) {
            if (j == 0)
                return lists[0];
            i = 0;
        }
    }
    return lists[0];
}
```

##### 19:00
The meeting got cancelled, so I guess I don't have much work to do.

> Going out, not working anymore!
