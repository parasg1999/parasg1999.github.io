##### 6:30
Starting a bit early today. I was looking at the `<Navbar />` yesterday and thought the performance on first reload could be improved by using `useEffect` instead of the currently used location listener. Voila! It worked.

See, I can do UI fixes as well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

##### 8:00
I was exploring the source code and figured out 2 major things - 
- The react router only works with `<Link />` component. The `<a/>` tags don't go well when working with SPAs.
- I don't know react.

> ```setTimeout(() => resumeWork(), 2 * 1000 * 60 * 60);```

##### 10:05
Started with the Crio bytes. Since I already knew the basics of HTTP, REST, Linux, and EC2, I was able to zoom through the modules pretty quickly. 

##### 14:30
Starting with today's [Leetcode Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/580/week-2-january-8th-january-14th/3599). At first I wasn't able to understand the question. I thought I had to calculate the minimum cost of creating the sorted array which got me confused. After reading it for the `n`<sup>`th`</sup> time, I figured that the elements have to be inserted in an orderly manner.

##### 15:00
It's been half an hour and the code I wrote to do the calculation is giving TLE, and I get it. The implementation is taking O(n^2) time to calculate the prefix sum.
I have no idea so I'm gonna take a look at the hint.

##### 15:20
So I studied about BIT aka Binary Indexed Tree, which calculates prefix sum in O(logn) time so the overall complexity of my program will go down to O(nlogn).

##### 16:00
Done with the code. Wow! New gun in my arsenal.

```cpp:title=create-sorted-array-through-instructions.cpp
int bit[100002];

// Find prefix sum of a number
int prefixSum(int num) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = num; i > 0; i -= (i & -i)) {
        ans += bit[i];
    }
    return ans;
}

// Update the prefix sum values
int update(int num) {
    for (int i = num; i <= 100001; i += (i & -i)) {
        bit[i] += 1;
    }
    return 0;
}

int createSortedArray(vector<int> &inst) {
    int ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < inst.size(); i++) {
        ans += min(prefixSum(inst[i] - 1), i - prefixSum(inst[i]));
        ans %= 1000000007;
        update(inst[i]);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

Again, no Go for this question. I'm just gonna put Go on hold for now unless I have some work on the back-end.

##### 18:00
Attending the Crio event now for REST byte.

##### 19:00
To be honest, after having developed a few production-ready APIs, I didn't learn anything new in the session but I guess I'll complete the byte and see what round 2 has for me.

##### 22:30
I started with building the Raahee server and made a boilerplate. Took some time to get the modules ready. Will be working on the database models now.

##### 23:00
Been writing models for the last 30 minutes and there are some issues. The conventions used in the document are inconsistent. `imageUrl` and `imageurl` in different collections. It's a bit frustrating to actually look for these things when back-end is generally the first thing built.

##### 23:30
I'm tired now and will continue tomorrow. Will possibly work on the authentication and basic doc creation for events and such.

> Okay Bye
