##### 10:00
Getting started with the remaining HackOn prizes section. I have 4 sections remaining and will update them when done
- [x] GraphCMS (10:25)
- [x] Other Prizes (10:40)
- [x] Main Prizes (11:15)
- [x] MLH Prizes (12:00)

##### 11:30
I also had to update the speakers for this year. I don't think we are getting any descriptions for the workshops this year.

##### 12:00
Completely done with the prizes section from my side. I'm pretty sure Rishabh will have something to say about this, but then again it's beneficial to talk on group about all this stuff so that it doesn't go past the ideation phase. 🤷‍♂️ 
What now? I think I'll work on the `AdminBlogPage` section now.

##### 17:00
Okay, so Rishabh says it's "bekaar". What a waste of time it was. 🤦‍♂️

New changes required in the prizes section cuz it looks "content heavy".

##### 23:50
Done with the prize section changes. Had to make a separate Modal for SAWO, but I guess it's all done now.

> Goodnight!

### Summary
1. Made changes `/prizes` page in HackOn

Wow, doesn't look much for today. But in any case, day's over and so is my energy.
