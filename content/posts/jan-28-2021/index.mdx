I was doing the [Leetcode Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/582/week-4-january-22nd-january-28th/3618/) last night but decided to do it in the morning instead. Now with my brain working in a better condition, I think it's time to solve the problem. 

Just get the number of bits in the current number, and multiply the answer till now with `2 ^ NO_OF_BITS` and take MOD.

```cpp:title=concatenation-of-consecutive-binary-numbers.cpp
int MOD = 1000000007;
int countBits(unsigned int number) {
    return (int)log2(number) + 1;
}

int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
    long long ans = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        int digits = countBits(i);
        while (digits--) {
            ans *= 2;
            ans %= MOD;
        }
        ans += i;
        ans %= MOD;
    }

    return ans;
}
```

Time complexity `O(n logn)`, space `O(1)`.

Time for Dijkstra's Algorithm now. I hope I can implement it.

Finally! God it feels so good! I can't believe I effing did it. 

So, the approach right? 
I am maintaining a vector `efforts` regarding the efforts (cost) to be put to go to a particular node.
Then inserting into set based on distance to get the minimum distance node. The vector `visited` tells whether the particular node has already been visited so as not to be stuck inside an infinite loop.

So after getting the minimum distance node, check the neighbours and update their efforts if the current node is a better way to reach that node.

Then update `min_dist` which stores the maximum of the minimum distance that need to be traversed at that point of time.

**Problems faced**
- I was updating visited as soon as I inserted anything into the set, instead it should've been done when erasing it from set.
- Updating `min_dist` as soon as I track the neighbours but it checks the `visited` property and then messes up the whole set.
- Returning too early - As soon as the target node was removed from the set, I returned without giving the chance to actually update the `min_dist`. This is the part which is still a bit cloudy but it's probably because I'm not visiting a node until I track it's neighbours.
This is related to the 2<sup>nd</sup> issue.

```cpp:title=path-with-minimum-effort.cpp
int minimumEffortPath(vector<vector<int>> &heights) {
    int m = heights.size(), n = heights[0].size();
    int dx[4] = {1, 0, 0, -1};
    int dy[4] = {0, 1, -1, 0};

    int min_dist = 0;

    vector<vector<int>> efforts(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX)); // All distance INF initially
    vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false)); // No nodes visited initially
    set<pair<int, pair<int, int>>> s;                        // To get node with MIN effort

    efforts[0][0] = 0; // SRC Node has distance 0

    s.insert(make_pair(0, make_pair(0, 0)));

    while (!s.empty())
    {
        auto p = *(s.begin());

        int row = p.second.first;
        int col = p.second.second;

        s.erase(s.begin());
        visited[row][col] = true; // Current Node has been visited

        min_dist = max(min_dist, efforts[row][col]);

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int new_row = row + dx[i];
            int new_col = col + dy[i];

            if (new_row < 0 || new_row >= m || new_col < 0 || new_col >= n) {
                continue;
            }

            if (abs(heights.at(new_row).at(new_col) - heights[row][col]) < efforts.at(new_row).at(new_col) && !visited[new_row][new_col]) {
                auto f = s.find(make_pair(efforts.at(new_row).at(new_col), make_pair(new_row, new_col)));
                if (f != s.end()) {
                    s.erase(f);
                }

                efforts.at(new_row).at(new_col) = abs(heights.at(new_row).at(new_col) - heights[row][col]);

                s.insert(make_pair(efforts.at(new_row).at(new_col), make_pair(new_row, new_col)));
            }
        }

        if (row == m - 1 && col == n - 1) return min_dist;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Time complexity `O(n*m + n*mlogn*m)` (Dijkstra's) and
space complexity `O(m*n)` where `m` and `n` are the rows and columns respectively.

Starting today's [Leetcode challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/582/week-4-january-22nd-january-28th/3619/).
Pretty basic problem after the above one. :p

Get the number of z in the string after accounting for the minimum number of a's to be inserted. Then add those z's. After that, add the character with the remaining value. Then remaining a's !

```smallest-string-with-a-given-numeric-value.cpp
string getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
    k -= n;
    string a = "";
    int no_of_z = k / 25, j = 0;
    k %= 25;
    for (; j < no_of_z; j++) {
        a += "z";
    }
    if (a.length() != n) {
        a += ('a' + k);
    }
    for (; j < n - 1; j++) {
        a += "a";
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        swap(a[i], a[n - 1 - i]);
    }

    return a;
}
```

Gave Crio.do test on HackerRank. It was really difficult considering the fact that it was supposed to be a "BASIC DSA TEST". But anyway, I don't think I'll get selected for the second round.

Have to go to Gurgaon tomorrow! Hoping for some good news there!
