##### 1:30
Hi hello! I made Maggi! I know, I can't believe it either. Gonna start working on fixing the Raahee website now. The App team has made a lot of changes and it's annoying to say the least.

##### 4:30
I'm finally done with community and profile update page after a long night. Took almost 8 hours to get everything up and running. That's longer than a typical weekday. Let's take some rest now.

##### 10:00
Bugs in website before demo. Could this BE any worse! I hate this.

##### 16:00
Starting with today's LocalHackDay challenges.

1. **Use Sendgrid API** : Did that yesterday.
2. **Create a ToDo list** : Build using simple HTML CSS and JS.
3. **Encrypt password** : This was challenging just because of the fact that I didn't want to create a whole new node bundle for a simple task. So I decided to go with playfair cryptosystem. Yay InfoSec course!
4. **Explore a buzzword** : PiSign -> password-less authentication

##### 22:00
Didn't get time to complete the Leetcode Challenge today so I'll complete it before it ends. But this is where my day ends! See you tomorrow!
