##### 14:00
Not feeling like doing anything today so I'll just be doing the [Leetcode challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/582/week-4-january-22nd-january-28th/3616/) for now.

The question seems very simple, and actually helps me maintain the lazy schedule I've been having today.

```cpp:title=check-if-ones-are-k-places-away.cpp
bool kLengthApart(vector<int> &nums, int k) {
    int index = -1000000;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        if (nums[i] == 1) {
            if (i - index <= k) return false;
            index = i;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

Time complexity `O(n)`, space `O(1)`. Pretty simple, oh I love one of these days.

Last day at Raahee. It feels as if I started recently. No, it's not a phrase. Anyway, I hope for GSoC this year. Going to work real hard.
I asked people for comverting to functional components and the PR seems to have caught my eye. There seems to be a bug and I'm pretty sure it wasn't tested before pushing.

I fixed it! Turns out, the bug wasn't so small as it seemed at the first glance. But done and dusted! :)

HackOn Meeting at 10:00, I feel kinda useless in these meetings. I mean these people, they know what they're doing. And me? I'm a nobody. I could never belong. Let's see what's in store today.

> I'll be back

##### 22:40
OKAY. So I attended the meeting and my face is red (literally). Nervousness!
These people are awesome and I hope I can learn a few things from them.

> I'm tired!
