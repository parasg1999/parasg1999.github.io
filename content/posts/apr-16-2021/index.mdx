##### 14:20
I have to work on the subheader for sponsor section on the HackOn website. I don't remember what has been done since it's been a really log time, but I think a lot of stuff was already done.

Okay, so the headers are pretty much already done. I just have to add the icons to segregate and then fix the sponsor tiles.

##### 15:40
Finally added all the logos and made each of them white. It actually looks pretty good.

##### 15:55
Rishabh didn't like the white logos, okay! Should've asked first :facepalm:

##### 16:50
Finally all the logos are updated to their colorful versions. Took a lot of time to do it all over again.
