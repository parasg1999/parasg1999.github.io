##### 12:30
I completed the Question 5 [WIPL](https://www.codechef.com/JAN21C/problems/WIPL) on Codechef last night but was too tired to write here.

The concept was to try and take minimum boxes first that can make a stack on `2*k` size and check if we can make individual stacks from those.  
The solution can be found at [41276886](https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/41276886).

Also got 30 points in Question 6 [ANTSCHEF](https://www.codechef.com/JAN21C/problems/ANTSCHEF). Just had to use `long long` for the result from yesterday.

Leetcode January Challenge [Day 5](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/579/week-1-january-1st-january-7th/3593/). Starting now!  
The question is pretty simple. Just have to check the next and prev values to ensure that current element is not duplicate. 

```cpp:title=remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list-ii.cpp
ListNode *deleteDuplicates(ListNode *head) {
    if (!head) return head;

    ListNode *ans = new ListNode(-1000);
    ListNode *temp = ans;
    int prev = -1000;
    while (head->next != NULL) {
        if (head->val != prev && head->val != head->next->val) {
            ans->next = head;
            ans = ans->next;
        }

        prev = head->val;
        head = head->next;
    }

    if (head->val == prev) {
        ans->next = NULL;
    } else {
        ans->next = head;
    }

    return temp->next;
}
```
Time complexity O(n), space complexity O(1).

Have to work on Raahee feture tomorrow for demo on 7th. Getting the report feature ready is a large task considering the time I have.
In any case, not feeling like working anymore today. So I'll get back tomorrow.

Also, this blog needs a feature for me to write something and only show when I'm logged in. I mean, what if I want to write about my feelings? Gonna do that after completing the Raahee features.
