There is a reason why I always think I shouldn't trust people, they suck. There have been so many times that I practically invest all my time and efforts for a single person. I can't even count all the people who have never talked to me once they got what they wanted. I mean I get that, that's how the world functions. I'm not somebody to be remembered, and why should anyone? Right?

Yeah, I'm ranting and I don't know what to say anymore but come on.

They say community is all about "togetherness". I say fuck that. I don't see anything like that. Acknowledgement? What's that? :shrug: 

You see the fucking website and tell me which things you think took the most amount of work, rate them difficulty wise and I can tell you I fucking made at least 4 out of the top 5 in your list.

And then they have the guts to tell me that "that guy is coordinating". :sobs: 

It's fucking great. Need to make this repo private now, cuz if you read this, it's just hate words on a public repo and that's not required. :/

Didn't work today! Just the Leetcode question, which doesn't deserve to be posted here.
