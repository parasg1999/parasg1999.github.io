##### 12:30
Received a mail from Crio yesterday about Winter of doing round 1. Isn't really a big deal since I don't even think they've shortlisted anyone yet. Waiting for the saturday event to learn more and see if it's as good as the hype surrounding it.
Starting Raahee work for today.  
Tasks:

1. Add registered users to the collection  
2. Add users on signup  
3. Add report and delete on community

Worked on Raahee users collection. Damn it was crazy focusing on all the little things so much so that I became frustrated at one point. Still have to add the already registered users to the test DB, and hope it doesn't break the app.

> Break!

Since I haven't been able to keep up with Go and all the other things, I am thinking about moving to Go for solving the competitive programming questions. Now, the single issue with that is I'll either have to write code in `C++`, or pseudocode first and then in `Go` which seems a little exhausting but I have to make that trade-off.

> When I think about it, it's like learning Spanish. You can't think in Spanish, but what you can do is think in your native language and then translate to Spanish. Following the same philosophy here. :)

Writing code in `C++` first.  
**Approach :** If the difference of prev and current element contain k elements, return the kth element from prev element.

```cpp:title=kth-missing-positive-integer.cpp
int findKthPositive(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
    int prev = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    arr.push_back(10000);
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        int temp = arr[i] - prev - 1;
        if (sum + temp >= k) {
            return prev + k - sum;
        }
        sum += temp;
        prev = arr[i];
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Time complexity O(n), space O(1). Translating to Go now.

```go:title=kth-missing-positive-integer.go
func findKthPositive(arr []int, k int) int {
    var prev, sum int = 0, 0
    arr = append(arr, 10000)
    
    for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
        var temp int = arr[i] - prev - 1
        if sum + temp >= k {
            return prev + k - sum
        }        
        sum += temp
        prev = arr[i]
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
