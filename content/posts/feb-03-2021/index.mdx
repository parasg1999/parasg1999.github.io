##### 15:00

Not feeling so good so I'll just be doing today's [Leetcode challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/february-leetcoding-challenge-2021/584/week-1-february-1st-february-7th/3627/). Question is easy and I've done it before so it probably won't be difficult.

```cpp:title=linked-list-cycle.cpp
bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
    if (!head) return false;

    ListNode *fast = head->next;

    while ((head != NULL) && (fast != NULL) && (fast->next != NULL)) {
        if (head == fast) return true;
        head = head->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }

    return false;
}
```

Time complexity `O(n)`, space `O(1)`

That's enough for today. Will be back when I'm better.

> Goodbye
