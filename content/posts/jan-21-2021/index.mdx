##### 23:00
Writing pretty late tonight. So I gave the test for Delhivery today and I think it went pretty well. For what it's worth, I think that there is a good chance but then again, luck never has my side now does it!

Since I forgot to complete yesterday's [Leetcode Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/581/week-3-january-15th-january-21st/3610/). Of course, a standard stack application, checking balanced parentheses.

```cpp:title=valid-paretheses.cpp
bool isValid(string s) {
    stack<char> stk;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (s[i] == '(' || s[i] == '{' || s[i] == '[') {
            stk.push(s[i]);
        } else if (stk.empty()) {
            return false;
        } else {
            if (s[i] == ')' && stk.top() == '(') {
                stk.pop();
            } else if (s[i] == ']' && stk.top() == '[') {
                stk.pop();
            } else if (s[i] == '}' && stk.top() == '{') {
                stk.pop();
            } else return false;
        }
    }
    return stk.empty();
}
```

Now, today's [question](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/581/week-3-january-15th-january-21st/3611/) seemed to be out of my league but I thought about a stack based solution that can find the smallest element in the first `n-k` elements and then proceed with the rest of the array.

```cpp:title=find-the-most-competitive-subsequence.cpp
vector<int> mostCompetitive(vector<int> &nums, int k) {
    int permitted_ops = nums.size() - k;
    stack<int> stk;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
        while (!stk.empty() && nums[i] < stk.top() && permitted_ops > 0) {
            stk.pop();
            permitted_ops--;
        }
        stk.push(nums[i]);
    }

    stack<int> temp;
    vector<int> ans;

    while (!stk.empty()) {
        temp.push(stk.top());
        stk.pop();
    }

    while (!temp.empty() && k--) {
        ans.push_back(temp.top());
        temp.pop();
    }

    return ans;
}
```

That's all for today. I think I'll read a book now. Not gonna write more since I don't wanna jinx it. 

> Bye!
