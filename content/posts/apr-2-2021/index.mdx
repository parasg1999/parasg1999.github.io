Well I have to work on that insurance project and there is no motivation to do anything. The thing that's bothering me is that I don't believe in the project and there is no USP, so I'm not sure why these people want to work on this. :/

Anyway, I have to create a profile page and user sections. Let's get started!

Done with the insurance listing based on the type of insurance that the person wants to buy.

The current system works with the profile page and then selecting what insurance to buy. There is no way to insert the insurance details so that's being done manually in firebase.

After the customer decides which one to buy, the insurance is added to their account.

Not done with today's Leetcode question yet, will probably do it in a while.
