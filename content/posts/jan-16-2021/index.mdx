Just solving today's [Leetcode challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/581/week-3-january-15th-january-21st/3606/) and then relaxing

int findKthLargest(vector<int> &nums, int k)
{
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end(), greater<int>());
    return nums[k - 1];
}
```
