##### 7:50
Starting the day a little early than usual, but I am not really sure if I can get work done during daylight. Need to work on a bug that is causing the snackbar to show "invalid hook call".
I'm pretty sure that has to do with reckless code adding without testing.

##### 8:15
Yup, made a Higher Order Component to wrap the Add Event Component and called the hook there, passed the `enqueueSnackbar` down from there! React++ 😉

<a name="withSnackbar"></a>

```jsx:title=src/HOC/withSnackbar.jsx {5,7}
import React from 'react';
import { useSnackbar } from 'notistack';

const withSnackbar = (Component) => (props) => {
  const { enqueueSnackbar } = useSnackbar();
  return (
    <Component {...props} enqueueSnackbar={enqueueSnackbar} />
  );
};

export default withSnackbar;
```

This feels good!

##### 10:50
After a long power cut, and significantly behind schedule, I'm back. First things first, trying to solve the 4th question in Long Challenge.

##### 11:30
Wow squares do help with collision. The trick? Well there can only be a maximum of 4 collisions no matter what. The Link to solution is [41071146](https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/41071146).  
Time to complete the Raahee reported content feature.

##### 12:30
After an hour of overcoming the UI hurdles, I have a somewhat respectable UI for the cards and the details are being displayed properly. The only thing left is to wait for the action list. 

##### 14:00
Have been banging my head around the 5th problem on codechef for a while nnow and I can't seem to get it. From what I gather, it's like the normal coin change problem but with same amount twice. Guess I'll have to go back to basics.  
Well, on the Leetcode side, I completed the challenge [Day 2](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/579/week-1-january-1st-january-7th/3590/) pretty quickly today. Had to find the corresponding nodes in a cloned tree, so it wasn't really difficult.

```cpp
TreeNode *getTargetCopy(TreeNode *original, TreeNode *cloned, TreeNode *target) {
    if (original == NULL)
        return NULL;

    if (original == target) {
        return cloned;
    }

    TreeNode *left = getTargetCopy(original->left, cloned->left, target);

    if (left != NULL) {
        return left;
    }

    TreeNode *right = getTargetCopy(original->right, cloned->right, target);

    if (right != NULL) {
        return right;
    }

    return NULL;
}
```

Time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of nodes. Space complexity is O(n) if the tree is like a linked list.

> I need a break!

##### 16:40
Completely done with the Reported Content feature. Working alright! Used Material UI Snackbar `notistack` to create prompts. Looks awesome 👏

I also realised out that notistack already contains the [withSnackbar](#withSnackbar). Bummer I mean, but at least I made it myself. I mean a lot of things are already coded, doesn't mean you can find them when you want. 

##### 17:10
Starting today's GoRoutine!  
**Aim :** Creating a module and calling it from other module, helps in package publishing I guess. Following [documentation](https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module).

##### 17:50
Caveats with Go
- First letter of function name defines if the function is public(capital letter) or private(small letter)
- Requiring custom modules means building first, wow!  
Enough Go for today, it's a bit messed up! 

It's 21:33 and I couldn't be anymore tired, the day ends here. Could've been better but I'm satisfied with today.
