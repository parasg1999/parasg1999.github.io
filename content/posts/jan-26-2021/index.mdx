##### 4:00
I was browsing the internet when I found something. [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) brings voice controls so you can do whatever you want with you PC. Now that's pretty cool. I'm planning to explore it today and let's see if I can something cool with it. 

I have always wanted to do some basic interaction with voice, I mean I don't want to get my hands out of my blanket when I want to pause a movie. *VLC Pause* seems to be a pretty good option in my opinion. 

##### 7:00
Oh damn! I didn't even realise that it's already 7. Anyway, I really enjoyed playing around with Talon but it still has a long way to go. No matter how hard I tried, the help module was always difficult to understand and the key bindings for i3wm are a bit weird.

> I'll sleep now!

##### 16:00
I tried solving the Leetcode challenge but my brain doesn't seem to work. Will try again later. 

##### 23:00
I'm sure it has to do something with Dijkstra's Algorithm, and I'm sleep deprived so maybe during class tomorrow.

> Bye
