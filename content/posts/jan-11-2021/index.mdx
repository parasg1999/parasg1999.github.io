##### 16:00
I know what you wanna say - *Wake up early! This is no way to live.*
Agreed!

Anyway I submitted a couple of challenges in MLH LocalHackDay and just completed the [Leetcode Daily Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/580/week-2-january-8th-january-14th/3600/).
Had to merge two sorted arrays in the first array. I looked at the constraints and my immediate reaction was 200 elements, that's too low so I implemented the way we merge arrays but the inplace thing turned out to be more challenging that it initially seemed. So I merged the two arrays together and did the sort on them since you know, 200.

```cpp:title=merge-sorted-array.cpp
void merge(vector<int> &nums1, int m, vector<int> &nums2, int n) {
    if (n == 0) return;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        nums1[m + i] = nums2[i];
    }

    sort(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
    return;
}
```

##### 23:30
I didn't write a lot today. Most of the time I was working on MLH Local Hack Day. I have 15 points on Day 1.
Could this BE any better!?

Anyway it's already 00:30 on 12<sup>th</sup>, so I'll go and work on Raahee Blog now.
