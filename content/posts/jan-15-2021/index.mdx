I'm not supposed to be working right now and I should probably sleep but I just got an awesome idea. Make a discord bot that uses a playlist to feed to groovy. Why can't I play my liked songs on discord? ðŸ˜¢

##### 12:00
I started working on Leetcode Challenge for [14<sup>th</sup>](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/580/week-2-january-8th-january-14th/3603/). Used sliding window to get the result. Time complexity `O(n)` and space complexity `O(1)`.

```cpp:title=minimum-operations-to-reduce-x-to-zero.cpp
int minOperations(vector<int> &nums, int x) {
    int sum = accumulate(begin(nums), end(nums), 0);
    int l = 0, r = 0, res = INT_MAX, sz = nums.size();
    while (l <= r)
        if (sum >= x) {
            if (sum == x)
                res = min(res, l + sz - r);
            if (r < sz)
                sum -= nums[r++];
            else
                break;
        }
        else
            sum += nums[l++];
    return res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res;
}
```

Now back on today's [Leetcode Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/581/week-3-january-15th-january-21st/3605/). The problem seems simple with some basic arithmetic. Just get the n<sup>th</sup> integer with loop.

```cpp:title=get-maximum-in-generated-array.cpp
int getMaximumGenerated(int n)
{
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;
    int arr[n + 1];
    arr[0] = 0;
    arr[1] = 1;
    int m = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        if (i % 2 == 0) {
            arr[i] = arr[i / 2];
        } else {
            arr[i] = arr[i / 2] + arr[(i / 2) + 1];
        }
        m = max(m, arr[i]);
    }
    return m;
}
```

Time complexity `O(n)` and space `O(1)`

Not gonna work tonight, need a break.
