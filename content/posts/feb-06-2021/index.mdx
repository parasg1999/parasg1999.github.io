Let's start today's [Leetcode challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/february-leetcoding-challenge-2021/584/week-1-february-1st-february-7th/3630/). It looks a bit weird, the question doesn't seem to provide appropriate information.

My approach is to traverse the right path and printing it in order. Now this approach seems to be wrong and I can unserstand why. "Standing on the right" of the tree means seeing the tree from the right and seeing the first node that's in front. So I need to travserse the tree using preorder traversal and store the node values on left tree with their heights, and if a node exists to it's right on the same level, update the value.

```cpp:title=binary-tree-right-side-view.cpp
map<int, int> m;

void traverse(TreeNode *root, int height) {
    if (!root) return;

    m[height] = root->val;
    traverse(root->left, height + 1);
    traverse(root->right, height + 1);
}

vector<int> rightSideView(TreeNode *root) {
    traverse(root, 0);

    vector<int> v;

    for (auto a : m) {
        v.push_back(a.second);
    }

    return v;
}
```

The complexity is `O(N)` and space complexity is `O(N)` where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
