Woke up on time today (really!), and I thought *"It's new year, let's build some habits."*. I went ahead and completed the blog on Arch installation. Feels like a milestone to be honest. I mean it's great to have someone who's constantly asking you to complete a task.

I also decided to go ahead and start this blog as my daily programming journal. I think only I can hold myself accountable.

##### 12:50
Installed Go. Wow the internet seems to want me to work today. xD

Just completed the Leetcode January Challenge [Day 1](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/january-leetcoding-challenge-2021/579/week-1-january-1st-january-7th/3589/).
Althought the problem seemed a bit challenging, I used hash table to store the first element of each piece with the repective vector. When I encounter the first number of a piece in array, I fetch the array and compare till the piece finishes.

```cpp
bool canFormArray(vector<int> &arr, vector<vector<int>> &pieces) {
    unordered_map<int, vector<int>> umap;
    for (int i = 0; i < pieces.size(); i++) {
        umap[pieces[i][0]] = pieces[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size();) {
        if (umap.find(arr[i]) == umap.end()) {
            return false;
        } else {
            for (int j = 0; j < umap[arr[i]].size(); j++) {
                if (arr[i + j] == umap[arr[i]][j]) { }
                else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            i += umap[arr[i]].size();
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```
The time complexity is O(n) even with the nested loop, and the space complexity is also O(n).

**Optimization? Trade-off!**: The hash table could be eliminated and sorting implemented which would take O(nlogn) time and O(1) space.

Helped Deepesh install arch on his PC, and failed miserably. I still don't know what went wrong. 🤦‍♂️

Okay, I'm back. Getting started with Codechef long challenge. This time they have 3 divisions and I feel like it's not really worth the effort to solve these questions, but you know I will probably get better questions next month.
I'll just put the questions that I was able to solve today since it's a live contest and I don't want codechef to ban me. Oh I have an idea, I'll post the submission IDs and codechef will deny access until the contest ends. ***pats on back!*

Today's Questions:

1. Problem [DIVTHREE](https://www.codechef.com/JAN21C/problems/DIVTHREE) -> Solution [41008830](https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/41008830)
2. Problem [DECODEIT](https://www.codechef.com/JAN21C/problems/DECODEIT) -> Solution [41013204](https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/41013204)  
Wow this question was not difficult in itself but it was hard to implement. The ASCII conversion and substring had me occupied for a while.
3. Problem [FAIRELCT](https://www.codechef.com/JAN21C/problems/FAIRELCT) -> Solution [41015617](https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/41015617)

I finally got around to working on the last task of the day. I'm exhausted but I thought, if not anything else, atleast I should start making sense of the documentation.
Decided to write the traditional `Hello World!` program and test stuff out.

```go
package main // For grouping functions

import "fmt" // Package for formatting text

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello World!"); // For printing
}
```

Weird things:
- It's a lot like Java, I mean packages? I don't even remember how they work 🤦‍♂️
- The strings can only work with "double quotes". I KNOW! Judging too harshly? Coming from JavaScript with the template strings and what not, it's a bit inconvinient.
- And what is this with the func keyword

For what it's worth, it wasn't a complete disaster of a day. **Godspeed**.

Gonna watch a movie now, and probably work on the Raahee report feature later. Hope I sleep on time today.

###### Later!

Started working on Raahee Reported content feature. Really tired today so entire focus on functionality right now!

##### 00:40
Had to set up the project quite a lot, the small issues that projects have with dependencies. I just wanna sleep now! Anyway, I completed the data and display, just have to use it tomorrow to make a nice UI. For now, good night!
