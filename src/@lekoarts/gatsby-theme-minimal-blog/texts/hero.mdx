Before I sign off from here, here's a special thanks to [Shubhangi](https://twitter.com/knowshubhangi) for reading these everyday and motivating to write more, [Deepesh](https://twitter.com/deepesh_manwani) for making all those college years bearable and [Arjun](https://www.instagram.com/guy_called_arjun) (I don't think he has any public socials) for listening all the rants about placement when the going got tough.

The new content ends here, and although I can just alter the line below, I'd like to keep it here to reminisce to good 'ol times.
